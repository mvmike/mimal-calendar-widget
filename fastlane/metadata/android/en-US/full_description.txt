Minimal Calendar Widget that's always on current date's month
· 3x2 (resizable)
· Displays all events from your calendars with a symbol set (high number becomes generic)
· Native widget configuration for API 28 (Android 9) and higher (config icon on widget's top right corner otherwise)
· Pressing on any other part of the widget opens calendar application
· Configurable: start day of the week, calendar (gregorian or holocene), show declined events, focus on current week, open calendar on clicked day, theme, symbol set, symbol set colour, transparency, text size
